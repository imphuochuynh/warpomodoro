### WARPOMODORO

A minimal, immersive Pomodoro timer that replaces traditional numbers and interfaces with motion and visual metaphors. Instead of watching a countdown, you experience your focus session as a journey through hyperspace.

## About

WARPOMODORO transforms the conventional Pomodoro technique into a cinematic experience. As you work, stars accelerate around you, creating the sensation of traveling through a tunnel of light. The longer you focus, the faster you travel through space, building momentum and immersion.

### Key Features

## Philosophy

WARPOMODORO believes that focus is a journey, not a destination. By replacing the anxiety of watching time tick down with the satisfaction of building momentum through space, it transforms productivity from a chore into an adventure.

*"Time becomes motion. Numbers become experience. Focus becomes flight."*
